<h2>JSplacement: 2 - Custom sprites</h2>

<img src="guides/js2-2-01.jpg">

<p>
  <b>To create custom sprites</b>
  you will need an illustration software capable of exporting SVG files such as Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, or Inkscape.
  Please se attached image as a reference for creating your own sprites.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Start creating</b>
  your custom sprite by opening a new document.<br>
  Due to way JSplacement: 2 sprite scaling has been set, the canvas should ALWAYS be in 1:1 ratio<br>
  to avoid any issues with scaling, proportions, and tiling when using seamless generator.<br>
  The base color of JSplacement: 2 maps is rgb(128,128,128). Any higher value will go up, lower will go down.
</p>

<p>
  <b>After drawing your sprite</b>,
  scale it up or down to fit onto the canvas for the best result. For the reference, see the image on the right.<br>
  However, sprites that are intended to be smaller than the most can be smaller than the canvas itself.<br>
  Center aligning your sprite is not required. That one is up to your personal preference.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Import your sprites into JSplacement: 2</b>
  by opening user data folder in your home directory ("JSplacement"), or by pressing C on your keyboard.<br>
  Move your SVG sprites into "CustomSprites" folder and select "Custom Sprites" in JSplacement: 2's settings.
</p>



<br>
<p>
  <b class="upd">Warning:</b>
  While using PNG sprites with JSplacement: 2 is possible, SVG is much lighter and prefered option.
