<div class="allaboutit">

	<p><b>JSplacement</b> is a pseudo-random 8K displacement map generator made with JavaScript on <b>Electron</b>.
		It generates grayscale height maps that can be used for displacement (and many other things) in various 3D packages and renders.
		Or even with 3D fractals or various 2D works... Or even as Serum wavetable, apparently...</br></br>
		JSplacement is made in <b class="fin">Finland</b> with love by <a href="#" onclick="goToPage('https://windmillart.net')"><b class="wml">Windmill</b></a>.</br>
		Height to normal conversion by <a href="#" onclick="goToPage('https://threejs.org/')">three.js</a> until further notice.
	</p>

	<p><b>Terms of use</b></br>
		JSplacement is a free software. Anything generated with it can be used for commercial and non-commercial works. 2D or 3D. Or something else.
		However, you're not allowed to sell or redistribute this app and/or the maps it generates. That would be a scam, or, as I like to call it, <i>a dick move</i>.</br>
		If you paid for this application (other than voluntarily using my tip jar) or got it from any source other than <a href="#" onclick="goToPage('https://windmillart.net/?p=jsplacement')">WindmillArt.net</a>, please take necessary precautions and/or ask for a refund.</br>
	</p>

	<p><b>Privacy</b></br>
		JSplacement does not collect any user data and, as far as I know, neither does Electron on which it was built. No analytics. No ads. Nothing.
		However, JSplacement's version checker does perform a single HTTP request on launch to a plain text file on my server to fetch the latest version number.
		This adds an entry to web server's access logs as if you visited the page in question on your browser. This is what nearly every single website does.
		If you're feeling uncomfortable with that, feel welcome to block JSplacement in your firewall or disable version checker in JSplacement settings.</br>
