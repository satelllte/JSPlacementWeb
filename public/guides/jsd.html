<h2>JSplacement: dotGrid - Generator settings</h2>

<p>
  <b>Scale:</b>
  This slider defines the scale of dots on the map. By default this is set to 30.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Minimum brightness:</b>
  This slider defines the minimum brightness of the dots, which affects the visibility when used as a mask. By default this is set to 0.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Drawning chance %:</b>
  Unlike other generators, dotGrid uses systematic co-ordinate based system rather than amount of iterations.</br>
  Drawing chance defines the odds of a dot or pattern being drawn per point on co-ordinates.</br>
  By default this is set to 2.5.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Pattern max length:</b>
  The maximum lenght of the patterns. By default this is 5.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Dot shapes:</b>
  Series of switches for various types of dots. Turning all dots off will be overwritten by box only.</br>
  By default all are turned on.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Dot patterns:</b>
  Series of switches for various types of patterns which use selected dot types. Turning all pattern types off will disable patterns entirely.</br>
  By default all are turned on.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Break the code:</b>
  This switch disables necessary path closing in the code and turns on every single switch. It simulates the accidental broken code during the development of JSplacement 1.1.0.</br>
  By default this is turned off.
</p>
