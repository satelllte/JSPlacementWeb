<h2>JSplacement: 2 - Generator settings</h2>

<p>
  <b>Sprite set:</b>
  This is just as simple as it looks. A selector between sprite sets that come with JSplacement and custom sprites.</br>
  Please read next page for full documentation on how to make and use custom sprites.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Background brightness:</b>
  Control background color of the map for different results in whatever you're going to do with it.</br>
  In displacement, setting this to 0 will make everything extrude. 255 does the opposite. By default this is 128.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Background iterations:</b>
  These are sorted sprite draws which happen on the background to fill the holes on the canvas
  and, in most cases, lowers the required amount of sprites to fill the canvas.
  Each iteration creates a layer of random sprites in even formation.
  1 iteration draws a single sprite on whole canvas. 2 iterations draw additional 2x2 sprites.
  3 iterations draw additional 3x3. 4 iterations draw additional 4x4. Setting background iterations 0 will disable this feature.</br>
  Total count of sprites per levels are: 1 for 1, 5 for 2, 14 for 3, and 30 for 4. By default this is set to 3.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Iterations:</b>
  This is the main value of JSplacement: 2. It controls the exact amount of sprites drawn onto the canvas
  with exception when using seamless mode which occasionally performs multiple sprite draws based on co-ordinates.
  Please note that this is one of two key factors in JSplacement: 2's performance and it will slow down when set to a high value.
  By default this is set to 125.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Sprite scaling:</b>
  This is the second main value of JSplacement: 2. It controls the average size of generated sprites
  based on some math thing that I don't even remember anymore, but it made sense when I did it.
  Sprite scaling should be set together with the amount of iteration to achieve desired look.</br>
  Please note that just like iterations, sprite scaling affects the overall performance. Larger sprites take longer to generate.
  By default this is set to 60.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Seamless:</b>
  This switch enables or disables seamless generator mode. In seamless mode, sprites are drawn second time on the opposite side of the canvas
  if the sprite is out of bounds to create seamless repeating pattern. If sprite overlaps with a corner, additional 3 draws will be done.
  By default this is turned on.
<p>

<p>
  <b>Rotate sprites & Flip sprites:</b>
  When turned on, generator will randomly rotate and/or mirror the dreawn sprites to add extra variety to the generated map.
  Rotation is done in steps of 90 degrees (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°). By default both of these are turned on.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Blend sprites:</b>
  When turned on, generated sprite may use lighten/darken blending mode instead of normal mode.
  The odds of using blending modes are: 60% normal, 20% darken, 20% lighten. By default this is turned on.
